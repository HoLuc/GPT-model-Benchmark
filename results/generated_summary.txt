The young teen was reported to be surfing in an area deemed out of bounds by officials due to the high risk of sharks. The International Shark Attack File reports that there were 52 shark attacks in US waters in 2014, compared to 29 in 2015. Experts warn swimmers not to wear any jewellery or items that reflect the light. This is particularly important if swimming in choppy and unclear conditions which can make it harder for a shark to distinguish between swimmers and prey. Even brightly coloured clothing can cause trouble, as sharks see in black and white and use contrast to distinguish colour, meaning they will pick up the difference between skin and a bright swimsuit. Lounging on a surfboard in a wetsuit can give the outline of a seal from a shark's point of view. Where there are fish, there could be sharks and sharks eat fish. Try to avoid swimming or surfing near the exits of sewage pipes, the waste released will attract fish, which in turn will attract their predators. Some people have successfully chosen to be aggressive, others passive. Going back to back with other divers mean you can keep your eyes on the challenge from all directions and prepare to fight. Locals in Hawaii are increasingly placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water.

It can seem a good idea to take a romantic swim at sunset, but it is actually harder for sharks to spot the difference between humans and prey in darker conditions . Some people have successfully chosen to be aggressive, others passive. To this end, in the unfortunate situation where you come face to face with a shark (see below), the group can work together to enact defensive situations. Users strap the devices to their ankles, wetsuits or surfboards. Sharks are said to bite out of simple curiosity; they are known to bite anything that bobs on water just to see what it tastes like. George Burgess from the International Shark Attack File said: 'I advise to be as aggressively defensive as you are able. ' Of the 72 incidents of unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year, there were three fatalities . The 2014 yearly total of 72 unprovoked attacks was lower than the 75 recorded in 2013 and represents the lowest global total since 68 in 2009.", ' shows that in 2014, there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks around the world, with three fatalities in Australia and South Africa. The number of unprovoked shark attacks has been on the rise since 1900, with each decade recording more attacks than the previous. Despite the worrying statistics, only a minority of sharks are any danger to humans, with Great White, Bull and Tiger sharks accounting for the vast majority of attacks. Swimmers and surfers can take precautions such as swimming in groups and avoiding areas']

["Google launched a new U.S. wireless service today that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Google is selling the basic phone service for $20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month, instead of a flat rate. That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month. Those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data. Google has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator. Similar motives prompted Google to begin building high-speed, hard-wired networks capable of navigating the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services. However the savings really start when 5GB of LTE is consider - with the Internet search giant's plan coming in at $70 and telecom giant Verizon's costing $110 a month .

Cunera Buijs from the National Museum of Ethnology said: 'When weather conditions permitted, the naatsit was often the only garment worn, both in the home and outside in the settlement.' A similar collection is on display at the National Museum of Ethnology, which came via the museum in Copenhagen . To make the grim garment, the wearer of the pants had to steal a coin from a poor widow at Christmas, Easter or Whitson and place it in the scrotum of the trousers, along with the magical sign called nábrókarstafur, which is drawn on a piece of paper. The coin is a 'tool to gather wealth by supernatural means,' according to the spokesman. In addition to the naatsit, the National Museum of Denmark's collection also features a diaper and a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur.", "During the 19th century Inuits in Greenland would have entertained polite company in their settlements while wearing a thong made of seal fur. When leaving the settlement, the female wearer would have worn it under trousers. Seals are found along the coast of East Greenland and are hunted by Inuits (stock image) for their meat and skin. These homes would have been built to keep in the heat, with a low corridor entrance positioned in such a way to cause warm air to rise from beneath the structure into the home, and stay there.

The home crowd paid tribute to their soon-to-be departing manager who twice led them to Bundesliga glory . Former Manchester United midfielder Kagawa made absolutely sure of that when he latched on to Mkhitaryan's ball with 10 minutes to play before escaping a challenge and firing past Kruse to complete a routine win.

["Jameela\xa0spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. ' So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. ' Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. '", "Jameela\xa0spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. ' Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. ' Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill.
